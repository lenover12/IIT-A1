  <h1><em>What I think</em> </h1>
  <p>
I’ve learnt that the big 5 is the standard for psychologist to measure and test personality, I was a little surprised at my results. Specifically, knowing my low score of 1/99 in Self-Efficacy has had a negative effect on my overall daily thoughts. I don’t believe personality is able to be tested with perfect results, we are much more complicated than that. But as I read through the Myers-Briggs and The Big 5, I was able to reflect on some of my weaker and stronger points. The tests have shown me that I think a lot and act on emotion and genuine connection while my learning styles seem to also back this up. It is not a surprise at all that I am the type to sit back and observe, who likes having a mentor, and comes to solutions during breaks in work. I’m interested to study my ‘self’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working in a team with these personality traits will either benefit myself and my team, or not. I am clearly the type of person who will need to be part of discussions, but if the team isn’t working well together and creating stress filled and difficult situations then It will greatly impact my functionality. On the other hand, if the team and I are on better than average terms, my personality tests tell me that I will strive to go above their expectations, though this might not last for the entire period of a group project. Otherwise, I am observant and see the details, I require higher than average communication when I’m unsure of things, and when communicating I will bring up the details that other team members have overlooked and create positive time loss prevention in our work.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to form a team, I would look for a leader who is positively encouraging when they need to be, I only need a small amount of positive reinforcement every now and then. I would want clear communication and tasks clearly divided. The team that I would work best in doesn’t need to be great, a team member can be unskilled and require my assistance and I would gladly help if I can see they are putting in the effort. I can take my place focusing on the small details, organising, connecting group work together, keeping team members up to date, and focusing intently on my own given task. I’m unsure what tasks I would be best at performing right now, though having restricted instructions with a little freedom would be the best draw of my abilities.
