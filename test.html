  <h1><em>What I think</em> </h1>
  <p>
I’ve learnt that the big 5 is the standard for psychologist to measure and test personality, I was a little surprised at my results. Specifically, knowing my low score of 1/99 in Self-Efficacy has had a negative effect on my overall daily thoughts, though personality traits are to a certain degree, malleable. As I read through the Myers-Briggs and The Big 5, I was able to reflect on some of my weaker and stronger points. The tests have shown me that I think a lot and act on emotion and genuine connection while my learning styles seem to also back this up. It is not a surprise at all that I am the type to sit back and observe, who likes having a mentor, and comes to solutions during breaks in work.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what I have read, I am the type of person who will be an active member of a well-functioning team, my ability to think logically, interest in the project & team members, and creativity are all enhanced by positive teamwork environments. I am observant and I do hang back while thinking for myself, this is how I construct an idea or approach to a task, and when I articulate my perspective it will address items that have been overlooked.
The results tell me that for me to maintain this effort I need a reason that is continuously reinforced or changing to keep my interest. There is also the idea that I will disbenefit my team, this will happen if the team members and I have unresolved conflicts or feelings of disrespect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to form a team, I would look for a leader who is encouraging when they need to be, I personally only need a small amount of positive reinforcement every now and then and I believe most people benefit from it. I would want clear communication and tasks clearly divided. The team that I would work best in doesn’t need to be great, a team member can be unskilled and require my assistance and I would gladly help if I can see they are putting in the effort. I can take my place focusing intently on my own given tasks, as well as attend to smaller details, organising, and connecting group work together. With the information I have I’m unsure what tasks I would be best at performing as I have some contradictory personality profile results, though, I think having restricted instructions with a little freedom would be the best draw of my abilities.
