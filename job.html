      Gameplay engineers are multi skilled support to the overall development of a game’s content, design, code, systems, mechanics and user experience while working with team members from all fields. This job is specifically appealing for its role variety and is a fluid job title often defined by the company of which is hiring. Even with the job definition being fluid, one thing remains the same, gameplay engineers work closely within multiple teams. They combine work together by upgrading designers code and tweaking elements to improve user experience and game mechanics. A gameplay engineer at the expert level has the ability to turn a great game into a masterpiece, they work with a variety of teams keeping them on track and contribute towards a clear goal with logic and creativity. I find this position exciting from its description and for the ability to work with creativity, logic, and variety, I’m focusing my sights on the expert gameplay engineer title that would require years of experience and repour.

      Gameplay engineer careers typically require an IT related bachelors, namely a Bachelor of Computer Science is the ideal choice. Focusing on game design, internships, and a well-designed portfolio focused on programming is recommended to increase hire-ability. A more streamline method to attain this job role is to come out of a bachelors into the role of a game developer while honing and building up multiple skills, completing certificates and staying up to date with coding languages and tools, this will efficiently suit the role of a gameplay engineer. What’s more, a gameplay engineer would need to demonstrate their ability to communicate effectively, they will come into the role with multiple skills under their belt and will be hired depending on whether their skills suit the project’s needs as well as the needs of the co-workers.

      I have past experience with some fundamental skills required for this career, but as an ant is to a mountain, the comparison of what skills I have, and what skills I need leaves something to be desired. For instance, I studied high-school programming 101 using the BASIC command language, and I’ve written small executable ‘commands’ I learnt from a wiki to edit some of the functions in the game Minecraft, though a considerable skill I have is in knowing what I enjoy and excel at.

      For me, bachelors in IT is a starting point, from here I’d like to work abroad in the IT industry and develop my skill, or study computer science abroad in a university while doing an internship. To become a desirable applicant for a gameplay engineer job, I will study for certificates and pass exams, learning new languages and skills while also building my focused portfolio. I will be hired into a job with a clear path towards the gameplay engineer role and use that position to develop and move forwards into multiple roles where I will continue to build my skills and progress my career to the level of expert.
